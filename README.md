# Fake QQ

Fake QQ is a application that allows users to chat with each other. It's half way done from now(the server and the login page layout is not fully done). Once the server is opened from the file MyServerFrame, users can login to their account by running the file QqClientLogin. By entering QQ号码（userId） 1 and QQ密码（user password） 123456 and click 登录(login), the server will allow user to go online and see their friendlist and chat etc..
